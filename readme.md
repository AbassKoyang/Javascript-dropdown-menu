The code is a simple web page that demonstrates a custom menu design created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu allows users to select a social media platform from a dropdown list.

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

HTML Structure: The HTML contains a <div> element with the class "hero," which serves as the main container for the custom menu. Inside it, there's a <div> element with the class "selector," representing the select field for the menu. The select field consists of a text label (p tag with id "selectText") and an arrow icon (i tag with class "ri-arrow-down-s-line" and id "arrowIcon").

CSS Styles: The CSS styles define the layout and appearance of the custom menu. The "hero" class sets up a full-width and full-height container with a gradient background. The "selector" class styles the select field and positions it in the center of the container. The "options" class represents each option in the dropdown menu.

JavaScript Functionality:

The JavaScript code selects the necessary elements from the HTML using their IDs or class names.
It sets up a click event listener on the "selectField" element, which toggles the "rotate" class on the arrow icon and shows or hides the dropdown menu when the select field is clicked.
It also sets up click event listeners for each option in the dropdown menu. When an option is clicked, the selected text is displayed in the select field, and the dropdown menu is hidden.
Media Query: There's a media query for screen widths between 320px and 380px, which adjusts the width of the select field and dropdown menu to make it responsive on smaller screens.

The overall result is a visually appealing custom menu that allows users to select a social media platform from the dropdown list. The selected option is displayed in the select field, and the menu can be opened and closed by clicking on the select field.
